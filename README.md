# Optogenetic Lightbox for Axolotl Regeneration Study 

## Project Overview 
This repository contains all the necessary documentation, design reports, instructions, and CAD/laser cutting files for the Optogenetic Lightbox designed for the study of axolotl regeneration. Our project aims to advance the field of regenerative medicine by enabling precise control of light exposure to axolotls, facilitating the study of their regenerative capabilities under different light conditions.
